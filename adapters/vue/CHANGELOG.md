# @symbiote-native/vue

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 6010442: Move `@symbiote-native/engine` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`>=0.1.0`) in every adapter and every package that imports engine internals, matching the existing `react`/`react-native` singleton-peer treatment. Engine holds module-scope singleton state — the node-identity `BRAND` symbol `isSymbioteNode`/`createElement` share, and the WeakMap-based commit mirror — that MUST be the same module instance everywhere it's touched. As a regular `dependencies` entry, each package independently resolved (and, once published via pkg.pr.new at a different point in the same session, independently pinned) its own copy of engine; inside a standalone `npm install` outside the pnpm workspace (`examples/*`), npm cannot dedupe distinct commit-pinned canary URLs, so multiple copies of engine landed side by side in `node_modules`, each with its own `BRAND` symbol.

  This surfaced as Angular's `HeaderOptionsScreen` search-bar buttons (`focus`/`setText`/`clearText`/`cancelSearch`) silently no-op'ing: `SearchBarRefDirective` reads the native node via `ElementRef.nativeElement` (created by `@symbiote-native/angular`'s own copy of `createElement`) and checks it with `@symbiote-native/navigation`'s own copy of `isSymbioteNode` — a genuine cross-package identity check that only Angular's ref-attachment shape happens to make (React/Vue's search-bar ref is a callback-prop resolved inside the SAME `createElement` call, so it never crosses a package boundary). `isSymbioteNode` returned `false` despite the object being a real, correctly-shaped native node — a different engine module's `BRAND` symbol, not a missing one — so the ref's `.current` stayed `null` forever, silently.

  Root-caused live via `mobile-mcp` device interaction (native search-bar tap fired `onFocus` correctly; imperative ref-driven buttons did not) plus a throwaway diagnostic patch of the installed `node_modules` copy dumping `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(node).length` — confirmed exactly one (foreign) symbol present, not zero. `@symbiote-native/engine` now resolves to one singleton instance per consuming app, the same way `react`/`react-native` already do.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 090c789: Fix the Metro SFC transformer crashing on a type-only `defineProps<X>()` where `X` is imported from another file (relative or bare-specifier) — `compileScript` had no `fs` access and no registered TypeScript resolver, so it threw "No fs option provided" / "TypeScript is required" instead of resolving the prop type.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 706e52f: Fix `scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs` baking a literal `/index.js` extension folder-as-module directory imports (`component-names/`, `share/`, `alert/`, `platform/`, `status-bar/`, `accessibility-info/`, `linking/`, ...) that also carry `index.ios.js`/`index.android.js` siblings. Once the specifier is explicit, Metro's platform-extension layering never runs, so every platform silently resolved to the same (iOS-hardcoded, headless-fallback) file — on Android this surfaced as `Can't find ViewManager 'PullToRefreshView' nor 'RCTPullToRefreshView'` and similar wrong-native-name crashes. The script now detects platform-specific siblings and leaves those specifiers extensionless, matching react-native-builder-bob's own accepted approach for the same tension (Node ESM needs explicit extensions; Metro needs them omitted to layer `.ios`/`.android`/`.native`). Known tradeoff, same as bob: a plain headless Node/ESM import reaching one of these folders directly (bypassing Metro) will fail to resolve — nothing in this repo currently does that.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c66082c: Fix relative imports missing file extensions in the published `build/` output, which broke every published package for real Node ESM consumers (Vitest, plain `node`, non-Metro bundlers) — `import('@symbiote-native/vue')` failed outright with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Metro's own resolver is lenient about missing extensions, which is why this went unnoticed until a published package's compiled output was consumed directly through Node's native ESM loader for the first time.

  The fix runs as a post-build step (`scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs`, wired into the root `build` script right after `typecheck`) that rewrites relative import specifiers in the already-compiled `build/**/*.js` files. It does not touch `src/*.ts` — Metro's resolver treats an explicit extension as literal (it only layers `.ios`/`.android`/`.native` suffixes on top, unlike `tsc`/Node's `.js`-maps-to-`.ts` resolution), so adding `.js` extensions directly in the TypeScript source breaks Metro's dev-mode resolution of the unbuilt source. Confirmed by reverting an earlier source-level attempt after it broke the local Vue example apps' bundling.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b0f2568: Package Metro/Babel/tsconfig build tooling that previously only lived in the example apps, so a consuming app no longer copies files out of this repo to use these adapters.

  - `@symbiote-native/css-parser`'s `createCssMetroTransformer()` now resolves `@react-native/metro-babel-transformer` itself (a real dependency of this package) instead of requiring the caller to pass it in.
  - `@symbiote-native/vue` ships its `.vue` SFC Metro transformer as `./metro-vue-transformer` (previously only a copy-pasted file in `examples/vue-sfc`).
  - `@symbiote-native/angular` ships `./babel-linker` (wraps `@angular/compiler-cli/linker/babel`), `./tsconfig.angular.base.json` (a base config for a consumer's own `tsconfig.angular.json` to extend), `./metro-config`'s `withSymbioteAngularMetroConfig` (CSS sourceExts + the ngc-outDir style-import redirect), and a `symbiote-angular-dev` bin (a cross-platform replacement for the old per-app `dev-with-watch.sh`, running `ngc --watch` alongside `react-native start`).

### Patch Changes

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ab42ee8: Add a zero-config host bootstrap (`bootstrapHost` in `@symbiote-native/components`, plus `registerApp` / `createApp` / `bootstrapApplication` per adapter) that wires the native-host seams and AppRegistry in one call, collapsing the manual per-app wiring every canary previously repeated.
