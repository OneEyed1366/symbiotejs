Move `@symbiote-native/engine` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`>=0.1.0`) in every adapter and every package that imports engine internals, matching the existing `react`/`react-native` singleton-peer treatment. Engine holds module-scope singleton state — the node-identity `BRAND` symbol `isSymbioteNode`/`createElement` share, and the WeakMap-based commit mirror — that MUST be the same module instance everywhere it's touched. As a regular `dependencies` entry, each package independently resolved (and, once published via pkg.pr.new at a different point in the same session, independently pinned) its own copy of engine; inside a standalone `npm install` outside the pnpm workspace (`examples/*`), npm cannot dedupe distinct commit-pinned canary URLs, so multiple copies of engine landed side by side in `node_modules`, each with its own `BRAND` symbol.

This surfaced as Angular's `HeaderOptionsScreen` search-bar buttons (`focus`/`setText`/`clearText`/`cancelSearch`) silently no-op'ing: `SearchBarRefDirective` reads the native node via `ElementRef.nativeElement` (created by `@symbiote-native/angular`'s own copy of `createElement`) and checks it with `@symbiote-native/navigation`'s own copy of `isSymbioteNode` — a genuine cross-package identity check that only Angular's ref-attachment shape happens to make (React/Vue's search-bar ref is a callback-prop resolved inside the SAME `createElement` call, so it never crosses a package boundary). `isSymbioteNode` returned `false` despite the object being a real, correctly-shaped native node — a different engine module's `BRAND` symbol, not a missing one — so the ref's `.current` stayed `null` forever, silently.

Root-caused live via `mobile-mcp` device interaction (native search-bar tap fired `onFocus` correctly; imperative ref-driven buttons did not) plus a throwaway diagnostic patch of the installed `node_modules` copy dumping `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(node).length` — confirmed exactly one (foreign) symbol present, not zero. `@symbiote-native/engine` now resolves to one singleton instance per consuming app, the same way `react`/`react-native` already do.
