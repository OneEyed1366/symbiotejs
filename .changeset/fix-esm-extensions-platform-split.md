Fix `scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs` baking a literal `/index.js` extension folder-as-module directory imports (`component-names/`, `share/`, `alert/`, `platform/`, `status-bar/`, `accessibility-info/`, `linking/`, ...) that also carry `index.ios.js`/`index.android.js` siblings. Once the specifier is explicit, Metro's platform-extension layering never runs, so every platform silently resolved to the same (iOS-hardcoded, headless-fallback) file — on Android this surfaced as `Can't find ViewManager 'PullToRefreshView' nor 'RCTPullToRefreshView'` and similar wrong-native-name crashes. The script now detects platform-specific siblings and leaves those specifiers extensionless, matching react-native-builder-bob's own accepted approach for the same tension (Node ESM needs explicit extensions; Metro needs them omitted to layer `.ios`/`.android`/`.native`). Known tradeoff, same as bob: a plain headless Node/ESM import reaching one of these folders directly (bypassing Metro) will fail to resolve — nothing in this repo currently does that.
