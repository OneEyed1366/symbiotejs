# @symbiote-native/components

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 465c9e8: Extract two triplicated component machines into shared, framework-agnostic logic in
  `@symbiote-native/components`, completing the enriched three-layer split for the last two
  components that still re-implemented decision logic per adapter.

  Touchable: the TouchableOpacity press-scheduling machine (delayPressIn defer, early-release
  flush, activatedAt tracking, min-press-duration hold) and the TouchableHighlight underlay
  gating were re-implemented line-for-line in React, Vue, and Angular. They now live once as
  `createTouchableFeedbackRuntime` + `createTouchableFeedbackHandlers` (clock and scheduler
  injected, so the machine is testable and timer globals stay out of core) and
  `highlightPressedStyle`. Each adapter keeps only the `Animated.timing` opacity call, injected
  via `activate`/`deactivate`.

  ScrollView sticky headers: the per-header effect state machine (zero-swallow gate,
  rebuild-interpolation-on-input-change, debounce pick, cross-talk feed-forward) was hand-written
  in every adapter, and twice in Angular (component plus projection wrapper). It is now one
  `reduceSticky(state, action, inputs)` enriched reducer plus a `resolveScrollForwarding` decision
  helper that absorbs the onScroll branch, throttle defaults, inverted-height capture, and the
  collapsableChildren predicate. Angular's projection wrapper collapses to a thin effect-runner
  over the same reducer. Adapters keep only effect execution: the debounce timer, the
  interpolate/listener wiring, and the re-render trigger.

  Adapter prop surfaces and runtime behavior are unchanged; the rewrite is structural.

- 465c9e8: Extract the VirtualizedList orchestration into a shared, framework-agnostic `reduceList` state
  machine in `@symbiote-native/components`. Every list adapter (React, Vue, Angular) previously
  re-implemented the same after-commit effect skeleton — window recompute, `onEndReached`/
  `onStartReached` gating, viewability, batch fill, `maintainVisibleContentPosition`, the imperative
  scrolls — in its own reactive dialect, so the decision predicates (`last === count - 1`,
  `first === 0`, the batch-fill catch-up test, the viewability guards) lived three times and could
  drift. That logic is now one pure `reduceList(state, action) -> { state, effects }`; each adapter
  only maps native events to actions, holds one state cell, and executes the returned effects. Adds
  `reduceList`, `createInitialListState`, and `listEffectSignature` (plus their types) to the public
  `@symbiote-native/components` surface. Adapter prop surfaces and runtime behavior are unchanged —
  the rewrite is structural.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 1791d13: Consolidate several independently-duplicated pieces of logic found during an architecture review, with no behavior change intended:

  - `isSymbioteEvent` now lives once in the engine (`node.ts`) and is shared by `core/components` and eight Angular components that each had their own copy (the shared guard narrows `nativeEvent` to a non-null object, slightly stricter than a couple of the old presence-only checks).
  - `core/components/src/state/scroll-routing-handle.ts` gives `VirtualizedList`/`SectionList` a shared `IScrollRoutingHandle` base; `layout-event.ts` centralizes reading a numeric field out of `nativeEvent.layout`, replacing three separate reimplementations in `ScrollView`/`VirtualizedList`.
  - A new `createDeviceEventModule` factory in the engine's `native-modules.ts` backs `AccessibilityInfo`, `AppState`, `Appearance`, `BackHandler`, `Dimensions`, and `Keyboard`, each keeping its own degrade policy.
  - `touch-history.ts` and the image pipeline (`image-loader.ts` statics, `image-source-resolver.ts`) are extracted out of `events/index.ts` and the `Image` view layer respectively, so the view stays render-only.
  - `render-pressable.ts` exports `shouldSuppressPress`/`shouldClaimResponder`/`isTerminationAllowed`, now shared by the Angular Pressable adapter - this resolves one real divergence, aligning Angular's `cancelable === undefined` handling with the other adapters' native-default behavior instead of its old hardcoded `cancelable !== false`.

- 6010442: Move `@symbiote-native/engine` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`>=0.1.0`) in every adapter and every package that imports engine internals, matching the existing `react`/`react-native` singleton-peer treatment. Engine holds module-scope singleton state — the node-identity `BRAND` symbol `isSymbioteNode`/`createElement` share, and the WeakMap-based commit mirror — that MUST be the same module instance everywhere it's touched. As a regular `dependencies` entry, each package independently resolved (and, once published via pkg.pr.new at a different point in the same session, independently pinned) its own copy of engine; inside a standalone `npm install` outside the pnpm workspace (`examples/*`), npm cannot dedupe distinct commit-pinned canary URLs, so multiple copies of engine landed side by side in `node_modules`, each with its own `BRAND` symbol.

  This surfaced as Angular's `HeaderOptionsScreen` search-bar buttons (`focus`/`setText`/`clearText`/`cancelSearch`) silently no-op'ing: `SearchBarRefDirective` reads the native node via `ElementRef.nativeElement` (created by `@symbiote-native/angular`'s own copy of `createElement`) and checks it with `@symbiote-native/navigation`'s own copy of `isSymbioteNode` — a genuine cross-package identity check that only Angular's ref-attachment shape happens to make (React/Vue's search-bar ref is a callback-prop resolved inside the SAME `createElement` call, so it never crosses a package boundary). `isSymbioteNode` returned `false` despite the object being a real, correctly-shaped native node — a different engine module's `BRAND` symbol, not a missing one — so the ref's `.current` stayed `null` forever, silently.

  Root-caused live via `mobile-mcp` device interaction (native search-bar tap fired `onFocus` correctly; imperative ref-driven buttons did not) plus a throwaway diagnostic patch of the installed `node_modules` copy dumping `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(node).length` — confirmed exactly one (foreign) symbol present, not zero. `@symbiote-native/engine` now resolves to one singleton instance per consuming app, the same way `react`/`react-native` already do.

- 56ef0d9: Add the missing `"license": "MIT"` field to every publishable package's `package.json`. The
  `LICENSE` file itself was already shipping correctly (pnpm copies the workspace root `LICENSE`
  into a package's tarball at pack/publish time when the package has none of its own — confirmed
  against the already-published `@symbiote-native/slider@4.0.0` tarball on npm), but the
  `package.json` metadata field npm reads for the registry page's license badge and `npm install`'s
  own license check was missing on all eleven packages.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 706e52f: Fix `scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs` baking a literal `/index.js` extension folder-as-module directory imports (`component-names/`, `share/`, `alert/`, `platform/`, `status-bar/`, `accessibility-info/`, `linking/`, ...) that also carry `index.ios.js`/`index.android.js` siblings. Once the specifier is explicit, Metro's platform-extension layering never runs, so every platform silently resolved to the same (iOS-hardcoded, headless-fallback) file — on Android this surfaced as `Can't find ViewManager 'PullToRefreshView' nor 'RCTPullToRefreshView'` and similar wrong-native-name crashes. The script now detects platform-specific siblings and leaves those specifiers extensionless, matching react-native-builder-bob's own accepted approach for the same tension (Node ESM needs explicit extensions; Metro needs them omitted to layer `.ios`/`.android`/`.native`). Known tradeoff, same as bob: a plain headless Node/ESM import reaching one of these folders directly (bypassing Metro) will fail to resolve — nothing in this repo currently does that.

  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.1.4

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 46a4f27: Documentation and code-comment cleanup: remove internal-only references and tighten wording. No runtime or API changes.
- Updated dependencies [46a4f27]
  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.1.3

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c66082c: Fix relative imports missing file extensions in the published `build/` output, which broke every published package for real Node ESM consumers (Vitest, plain `node`, non-Metro bundlers) — `import('@symbiote-native/vue')` failed outright with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Metro's own resolver is lenient about missing extensions, which is why this went unnoticed until a published package's compiled output was consumed directly through Node's native ESM loader for the first time.

  The fix runs as a post-build step (`scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs`, wired into the root `build` script right after `typecheck`) that rewrites relative import specifiers in the already-compiled `build/**/*.js` files. It does not touch `src/*.ts` — Metro's resolver treats an explicit extension as literal (it only layers `.ios`/`.android`/`.native` suffixes on top, unlike `tsc`/Node's `.js`-maps-to-`.ts` resolution), so adding `.js` extensions directly in the TypeScript source breaks Metro's dev-mode resolution of the unbuilt source. Confirmed by reverting an earlier source-level attempt after it broke the local Vue example apps' bundling.

- Updated dependencies [c66082c]
  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.1.2

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ab42ee8: Add a zero-config host bootstrap (`bootstrapHost` in `@symbiote-native/components`, plus `registerApp` / `createApp` / `bootstrapApplication` per adapter) that wires the native-host seams and AppRegistry in one call, collapsing the manual per-app wiring every canary previously repeated.
