# @symbiote-native/android

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 56ef0d9: Add the missing `"license": "MIT"` field to every publishable package's `package.json`. The
  `LICENSE` file itself was already shipping correctly (pnpm copies the workspace root `LICENSE`
  into a package's tarball at pack/publish time when the package has none of its own — confirmed
  against the already-published `@symbiote-native/slider@4.0.0` tarball on npm), but the
  `package.json` metadata field npm reads for the registry page's license badge and `npm install`'s
  own license check was missing on all eleven packages.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Update package descriptions to the SymbioteNative brand name.

## 0.1.0
